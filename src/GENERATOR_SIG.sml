 (* Int, LargeInt and Position are the same structure and provide
    operations on type int.  In Poly/ML that is an arbitrary precision
    integer.  Poly/ML does not support any fixed precision integers.
    IntInf provides additional functions, such as logical operations
    on integers.  <http://www.polyml.org/docs/StandBasis.html> *)

 (* Operations on machine words treated as unsigned quantities.
    Functions which would overflow simply wrap round.  Poly/ML
    implements Word.word as 31 bit quantity on the i386 and PPC and a
    30 bit quantity on the Sparc.  LargeWord and SysWord implement a
    double precision version used in the Windows and Posix structures.
    Word8.word is an unsigned byte. *)
